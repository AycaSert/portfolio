In this project, the aim is to re-design the existing layout of the Manhattan island as if the grid plan has never happened. The beginning point of the project is the year 1811, the date when the map of Manhattan had meticulously drawn by John Randel Jr. On the first phase of the project as a team, we begin the project by studying the topography and the existing geological features of the island back in 1811. We divided the team into groups of; civil engineers, geologists, hydrologists, preservationists, urban planners and developers to work on a manifesto together on how the new city should function.Â  On the second phase of the project, we divided the island into 11 plots for each team member to work individually on their areas more in detail respecting the manifesto we set as a team. In this part of the project we were also required to select one landmark that is located on our plot to show the relation and to compare the scale between our plan for Manhattan and the existing city. On the third and last phase of the project, we focused on an individual block in the plot we designed and had a deeper look on how our plan is working in the smallest unit of the city.
