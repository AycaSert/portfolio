The aim of this project is to design a shade generator within the public space of Besiktas pier. Besiktas ferry station is one of the main transportation centers in Istanbul, connecting the European and the Asian side via sea transportation. The public space of the pier functions as a waiting area for the ferry users, and its location by the water attracts other people as well.

The structure is designed to be one body that will generate porous shade, enabling some sun light to pass through. Triangular forms are selected as the core unit of the structure, inspired by the geometric motives of the historical pier building

This model shows a further stage of the shade generator. The body of the structure consists of solid and void triangular forms that are raised by four pillars and are conjoined at the center. With the open triangular frames, the aim is to allow more sunlight to penetrate.
