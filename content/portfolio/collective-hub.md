![](/uploads/2018/01/27/3001 Model.jpg)Nuruosmaniye street is located in the historic peninsula of Istanbul. The street is within minutes of walk distances from the Grand Bazaar and the Nuruosmaniye Mosque. The area is surrounded with jewelry shops, antique stores and carpet stores and is a prime spot for both tourists and locals to shop. The aim in this project is to design a work place combined with public space, facing the Nuruosmaniye street. The design will serve market spaces for the local artists that produce work in such fields as; carpet viewing, jewelry design, ceramics and calligraphy to be rented for short term periods. The project seeks to create market areas for the commodities also with an exhibition area for the unique pieces to be on display and an event area to be used for workshops, conferences and greetings. The challenge is to maximize the public interaction with the building and sustain the public-private separation between the administrative unit of the building.
